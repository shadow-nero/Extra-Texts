"A set of matched swords favored by Archer.

by the master smith Gan Jiang."

"This Noble Phantasm is not used directly wielded
as a weapon. Rather, it is a powerful Reality
Marble that focuses one's inner being and projects
it onto the real world. The reality that this
particular skill creates is that of a magus who
devoted their life to mastering the art of the
sword, and makes available to the user every
sword-type weapon ever encountered by that magus
in their lifetime."

"A hero without a name. A fictional Heroic Spirit.
A Faker.

The remnants of a person who spent his human life
in the pursuit of justice. While the man who
spawned this Heroic Spirit was once a real,
living being, the slow passage of time has
completely erased his entire existence from the
records of human history.

The weapons he uses in battle are not technically
real, but are created using the thaumaturgy
technique known as Projection. All of the weapons
at his disposal are simply manifestations of
those he sees in his mind's eye and then
materializes in the real world."

"In his mortal life, Archer was a magus who barely
deserved the title, although he was a Master in a
previous Holy Grail War. While not even remotely
in the same league as Rin Tohsaka, he did possess
Magic Circuits capable of a single function.

While many people prate about justice and
equality, he actually went out of his way to be an
"Ally of Justice", often at the expense of his
own freedom. When faced with a potential disaster
that was beyond his power to prevent, he
willingly sold his soul to the Moon Cell in return
for a miracle. Now, instead of playing the part of
the hero, he willingly plays that of a Servant
instead.

As for the human he once was, no traces of that
person exist. Instead, he is now the
personification of what most people would imagine
one who holds the title of "Ally of Justice"
to be."
