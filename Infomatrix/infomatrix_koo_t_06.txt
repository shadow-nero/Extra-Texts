"A hero believed to be the offspring of a god and a
human. Demigods are fairly common amongst the
Heroic Spirits drawn from human mythology,
although few of them are considered more than
second-tier heroes by their adherents. This one,
however, is believed to have inherited the blood
of the Absolute One, the main god of his nation's
pantheon of immortal beings."

"A crimson spear that always finds its mark.
The truth of this weapon is far more sinister than
legend says. In a strange reversal of causality,
the target and ultimate effect of this weapon have
already been ordained. The only variable presence
in a successful attack is whether it is used or
not. Once used, it is not a question of if it will
hit, but how long it will take for its target to
die. Agility will not help one avoid Gae Bolg
should it be used, but instead it all depends on
one's Luck.
Gae Bolg is the most efficient and deadly of all
the Noble Phantasms, as it has a very low magic
cost and almost always results in a one-hit kill."

"This is a measure of one's Divine Spirit aptitude.
The higher the value, the closer they are to a
Divine Spirit. With each rank, their "purge

Sacred Fig" or "Protection of the Faith.""

"One of the great heroes of Ireland.

First appears as demigod in Ulster mythology and
is said to be the son of Lugh, the God of Light,
and Deichtine, the younger sister of Conchobar,
King of Ulster. His birth name was Setanta and
from an early age it was foretold that he would
become a hero of renown.

He was christened Cu Chulainn (which mean Culann's
Hound) after accidentally killing the watchdog of
a wealthy merchant. He took the name with pride,
vowing, "I will devote myself to the rearing of a
watchdog worthy of replacing the one I have just
slain and until such time as that dog is ready, I
will personally watch over and guard your life
with my own."

Upon becoming an adult, Cu Chulainn was enrolled
into the order known as the Knights of the Red
Branch and then sent to the warrior-woman Scathach
in the Land of Shadows to train as a warrior, and,
according to darker rumors, meet his death.
Fortunately, Scathach saw in him a worthy student
and disciple and passed on all that she knew of
both the martial arts and the more powerful
aspects of thaumaturgy. Upon the completion of his
training, Cu Chulainn was given the mighty demonic
spear Gae Bolg and told to depart from the Land of
Shadows.

After returning to be beloved homeland, his
triumphs were many...but that is a story for
another time."

"All of the stories that surround the legend of
Cu Chulainn are universal in their praise for his
loyalty, heroism, and compassion. And although he
was famous for his terrifying "battle spasms"
while on the battle field, his seemingly blind
rage never overcame his steadfast adherence to his
moral code.

Unfortunately, it was this unwavering adherence to
honor that in the end lead to Cu Chulainn's
demise. As a Celtic warrior, he was bound by a
number of geasa (taboos), the violation of which
would greatly weaken him. As a youth, he
single-handedly defended Ulster from the armies
of Queen Medb of Connacht. To add to the insult of
a single man annihilating her army, Cu Chulainn
came across her on the field of battle, but chose
to spare her life as he thought it dishonorable to
kill a woman. From that moment on, the desire to
see him die became an all-consuming passion for
the disgraced queen.

Medb eventually came up with a scheme to weaken
Cu Chulainn by using his own code of honor
against him. By forcing him to violate several of
the geasa that bound him, Cu Chulainn was
stripped of the divine protections and gifts that
were his birthright. However, he still managed to
die with honor, tying himself to a stone pillar
even as his life faded, as he vowed to never fall
in battle."
