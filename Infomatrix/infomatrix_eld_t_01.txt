"The name given to the Spanish naval forces during
the period of history known as the Age
of Discovery.

The Invincible Armada consisted of an estimated
65,000 men serving on more than a hundred large
warships, each of which weighed in at over 1,000
tons. Its might was such that it earned Spain the
reputation of being "The kingdom on which the sun
will never set.""

The logs themselves are illegible, with pages

their name as both an adventurer and

"This Noble Phantasm is Rider's ace in the hole and
forms the basis of her day-to-day life. With her
flagship, The Golden Hind, at the fore, a vast
flotilla of smaller craft expand ever outward and
exterminates her enemies with overwhelming
firepower. Its attributes contain vestiges of not
only the fleet that eventually defeated the mighty
Spanish Armada, but also of the stories involving
the golden stag and the eventide tempest that had
spread throughout the whole of Europe.

The eventide tempest is the encapsulation of all
storms, from blizzards to cyclones, which manifest
in the imagination of men as beasts and soldiers,
saviors and monsters. Depending on who is
speaking, the leader of these apparitions ranges
from a fallen King Arthur to the Norse god Odin
to the first murderer of men, Cain. In England,
it is believed that Francis Drake rides the
endless storm despite the fact that the role
assigned to her is usually given to malevolent
figures of history and myth."

"The person who circumnavigated the globe and paved
the way for England to become the dominate
superpower in the Age of Discovery through its
substantial earnings. This person was also the one
who was given credit for the virtual destruction
of Spain's Invincible Armada, which caused the
nation once thought of as "the kingdom on which
the sun will never set" to teeter on the edge of
collapse.

She is a person who has dedicated her life to
hedonistic pursuits and sees no difference between
a paragon of virtue and a rogue scoundrel. She
revels in all things gaudy, whether they are in
war or in her private life, and is content to
chase after ephemeral pleasures and leave nothing
of worth behind, much like the passing of a
raging storm.

She is particularly entranced with treasures of
gold and silver, but her true love lies not with
enduring treasure, but those treasures that
explode like fireworks and then quickly
fade away.

As she so often declares, "I chase after gold so
that I can scatter it like a storm!"

It is for this reason that she is wholly
incompatible with the King of Heroes that
symbolizes "an inexhaustible treasury." She would
also be at odds with the fox-eared Caster, as
Caster is the epitome of eternity.

As a devoted libertine, all that matters to her is
the inevitable crash at the end of it all.
A Heroic Spirit who is completely indifferent to
the frailty of human existence, she is content to
indulge in her own whims and desires until death
comes to greet her.

She died of dysentery at the age of 55. Her dying
wish was that she be buried in her full armor."

"Sir Francis Drake is generally considered the
first person to successfully circumnavigate the
globe (the first person known to have attempted
this feat +Ferdinand Magellan+ was killed halfway
through his voyage).

Though a male in life, Francis Drake has
materialized in Fate/EXTRA as a woman.

During the time of Francis Drake, England was
considered to be a second-rate power with no real
influence beyond its borders and no colonies of
worth overseas. It was primarily due to his
voyages and successes on the high seas that gave
rise to the British Empire. The combination of
the wealth he brought to the country and the
detailed maps he produced while circumnavigating
the globe allowed Britain to assemble a fleet that
rivaled that of Spain's.

An oft-mentioned aspect of the Drake mythos is
that of his ship, the Golden Hind. Not only was it
the flagship of Drake's fleet, it was seen as a
symbol of hope and a source of miracles. The
exploits the Golden Hind made possible elevated
Drake (known and feared by the Spanish as
El Draque) to a level on par with King Arthur.
Both are said to eventually return from their final
resting places, with Drake emerging from beyond
the ocean to lead England to true glory.

During what was to be the final confrontation
between England and Spain's Invincible Armada,
Francis Drake was commissioned as a vice admiral
in the English navy. Using an unorthodox strategy
involving the use of fire-ships, forcing the
Spanish fleet into open water where they could be
bombarded with cannon fire.

…it might be too far-fetched, but there's a rumor
that Drake traded places with Queen Elizabeth
several times after the Queen suffered an injury to
her face and couldn't show herself in public. Drake
has many such exaggerated tales, however."
