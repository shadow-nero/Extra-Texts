"Nursery Rhyme is not a hero in the traditional
sense. Rather, it is a general term for any
picture book that has managed to manifest itself
into a corporeal existence.

The genre itself, deeply loved by the children of
England, came into being as a reaction to the
half-voiced dreams of the young and eventually
emerged as a Servant who became a champion of the
innocent. It formed the foundation for perhaps the
best known work from the author known as Lewis
Carroll. His book "Alice in Wonderland" began as a
series of simple rhymes told to the daughters of a
family friend while rowing down the River Thames
on a warm summer's day.

The Servant Nursery Rhyme is actually a type of
Reality Marble. It projects the true feelings of
its Master and creates a pseudo-servant in a form
imagined by the one who summoned it."
