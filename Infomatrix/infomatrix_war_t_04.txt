"This is this Servant's Noble Phantasm and is
synonymous with the Servant himself, who in his
previous life was known as Kazikli Voyvoda, or the
Impaler Prince. The tortures and horrors released
by the multitude of spears that this Noble
Phantasm summons inflicts damage equivalent to the
immorality and depravity found in the soul of the
targeted opponent and can be seen as a form of
divine punishment.

During the time of his reign as monarch of
Wallachia, Vlad instituted a number of somewhat
oppressive and punitive policies aimed at the
lower levels of the nobility whom Vlad felt had
seriously undermined and destabilized his country
with their excessive corruption and political
maneuverings. In addition to laws designed to
curtail their excesses, he also carried out an
unprecedented number of impalings amongst the
noble classes.

While many believed he was simply trying to reduce
the number of rivals and opponents to his rule,
Vlad was shockingly ruthless in his approach to
justice, targeting commoners and the upper-class
with equal viciousness. His kingdom became a land
of horrors, culminating with the 1459 impaling of
an emissary from the Ottoman Empire, who survived
on the stake for several days before finally
succumbing.

According to Vatican records, the number of
impalements during his mad reign is believed to
have reached close to 100,000...not including the
soldiers of defeated armies or other victims from
outside of his country."

themselves for what they believe to be a greater

"Considered a heroic figure in Romanian history, he
was seen as a noble warrior who rebuilt and
maintained the kingdom of Wallachia as well as the
shield of Christendom against the threat of the
Ottoman Empire.

The name Dracula was the most common appellate
used when referring to Vlad III during his reign
as King of Wallachia. Originally a duke appointed
to his office under the auspices of the Eastern
Roman Empire, he adopted many of the customs of
that country's court, including signing all
documents in the early Roman style. The name
itself comes from his father's (Vlad II)
enrollment into the Order of the Dragon, a
monarchial chivalric order founded by Sigismund of
Hungary, who later ascended to the throne of the
Holy Roman Empire. His father took the surname
Dracul and Vlad III appended the "a", signifying
that he was "the son of Dracul."

The Order of the Dragon's primary purpose was to
defend the Christian world from the increasing
influence and might of the Islamic Ottoman Empire,
a calling that Vlad III enthusiastically embraced.
It is believed by some that he took the name
Dracula not only in honor of his father, but as
also as an announcement of his intentions of
safeguarding all of Christendom against the Turks
as the "Son of the Dragon."

In order to protect Wallachia from what he
considered the ravaging Turkish hordes, he
instituted a series of conscriptions and laws that
almost destroyed the noble class and the stability
of his realm, as well as resorted to measures
considered to be beyond monstrous even by the
somewhat barbaric standards of the time. His
cruelty and savagery was such that at one point he
had over 20,000 captured enemy soldiers impaled in
an effort to intimidate his foes. In the end he
was betrayed by the nobles he had turned his back
on and was assassinated at the age of 46
years old."

"Known as one of the greatest monsters of modern
history, the inevitable distortions and
exaggerations of scholars throughout the centuries
cannot wholly cover the well-documented horrors
and atrocities committed by his direct commands.
Although he is seen as a hero and savior by some,
the lengths he went to preserve the independence
of Wallachia and to repel the Turks will forever
paint him as an incarnation of satanic evil
on Earth.

1462 AD
This was the year in which he first used impaling
not only as punishment, but also as a form of
psychological warfare in order to slow down the
advances of the Turkish invasion into the western
kingdoms. With a force of just 10,000 troops,
Vlad III made extensive use of what are now known
as guerilla and scorched-earth tactics to harass
and weaken the enemy forces, which at one points
consisted of over 150,000 soldiers. At one point,
he drove his forces into the Carpathian Mountains
after annihilating the Turkish forces surrounding
the city of Bucharest.

The scene that the main Turkish force encountered
when they finally arrived to help the city was one
of nightmares. Surrounding the entire city was a
vast forest comprised entirely of impaled
soldiers, some 20,000 in total. It is said that
the lines of impaled Turks stretched for
kilometers in every direction. The sight of their
comrades' bodies impaled on stakes in combination
with the overpowering stench of decay broke the
morale and spirit of the Turkish army. Even
Mehmed II, son of the Turkish sultan and known as
the Conqueror, was shaken and ordered his forces
to withdraw, saying the following:

"I fear no man alive, but even I cannot hope to
fight the devil."

In the end, Vlad III rationalized his brutality
and his lack of remorse gave him a battle vision
far superior to those he faced. However, his
actions made him a pariah amongst even his
supporters and his life came to a tragic end due
to betrayal.

On an unrelated note, many military historians
theorize that Vlad's actions against the Turks are
the first time that guerilla warfare tactics made
their appearance and that they were the reason for
his many successes against a demonstratively
superior force. If one is to have so much success
defending something only to be repaid with
treason and assassination, isn't it reasonable to
assume that one would go insane from rage and
disappointment?"
