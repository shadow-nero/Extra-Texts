"A skill used to completely conceal one's presence.

Although this ability allows the user to become
almost completely invisible, the sheer amount of
magical energy required almost screams out that
some form of thaumaturgy is being used. Should
this person's opponent be a skilled magus, their
presence would be noticeable in some
extrasensory fashion.

There is a way to achieve this state of being
without the use of any kind of magical aid and
using only the abilities inherent within one's own
physical form, but the level of concentration
required is far beyond what humans are
capable of."

"Li Shuwen's blows are almost always fatal, whether
he throws a hard blow designed to kill or a simple
feint to draw his opponent into an attack. A
saying that has managed to survive the passing of
years is, "For Li Shuwen, a second strike is
needless." It is this saying from which his Noble
Phantasm gets its name.

To be accurate, this isn't a Noble Phantasm in the
traditional sense of the term. Rather, it is the
ultimate expression of the true power possible by
mastering the martial arts. Li Shuwen is
considered to be one of the very few to have
gained total mastery over his style, and in fact
was believed to have transcended the need for
physical attacks, instead defeating his opponents
by engulfing them in Chi.

There is much debate as to whether Li Shuwen
actually uses his Chi to defeat his opponents,
although the very few who have managed to survive
a confrontation with him report suffering all of
the effects associated with this type of attack,
such as obscured senses, heightened state of
paranoia, and the feeling that their nervous
system was under almost unendurable strain."

"A Chinese meditative ideal. It is a belief that
true mastery of martial arts comes not through
training, but acceptance. As this technique is
extremely difficult to understand, let alone
master, it is only when achieving the rank of A
that one is thought to have actually begun to
learn. Those with ranks exceeding A are considered
true masters of the art."

"Li Shuwen (1864-1934).

A Chinese martial arts master from Yanshan County,
Hebei-Cangzhou. One of the foremost practitioners
of the style known as Bajiquan, he was so powerful
that many remarked that with him, "a second strike
is needless as long a single blow will suffice."

In addition to his skills in hand-to-hand combat,
he was also supremely talented in the use of the
spear, so much so that he earned the name "Divine
Spear Li." His occasional use of this weapon
sometimes causes his opponents to mistakenly
classify him as a Lancer. While this wouldn't
normally be entirely incorrect, due to his
Master's desire for a stealthy Servant capable of
killing from the shadows, the traits more
associated with the Assassin class have come to
the fore.

On a final note, since his ability to become
invisible is based on his natural abilities and
not on any form of thaumaturgy, he is all but
undetectable to the vast majority of magi or
anyone dependent on magic."

"Li Shuwen, Master of the Demon Fist.

One of the few undisputed masters of martial arts,
he maintains a delicate balance between the innate
goodness and inherent evil found in all men. He
fell victim to poison after earning the undying
hatred of the countless families of those he
had killed.

As a Servant, the balance he maintained in life
has slipped slightly, but he still values
rationality greatly. While he does not see much
difference between good and evil, he will react
with disgust and utter contempt for those who
stray from rational thinking. And for those who
allow what Christians call "The Seven Deadly
Sins" to overwhelm their lives, he brings swift
and inevitable death.

Although he was known as a deadly fighter
throughout his life, in his later years he
discovered that true power lay not in the
strength of his fists, but in the strength of his
convictions. He spent the remainder of his life
following the path of valor, not violence.

He freely acknowledges that in his current
incarnation he is nothing more than a professional
killer, but does so without bitterness or regret.
And although he uses his powers as Julius directs,
could it be that...?"
