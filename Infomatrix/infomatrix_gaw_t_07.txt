"Arthur, said to be the mightiest of all the kings
to rule Britain, is believed to have ruled
sometime in the fifth or sixth century.

The sword that is said to have proclaimed his
right to rule was bestowed upon him by the
Elemental known in legends as the Lady of the
Lake. The entire episode was passed down in the
stories collectively known as "King Arthur and
the Knights of the Round Table.""

"The sword of Sir Gawain and the sister sword to
Excalibur. It is said that like Excalibur,
Galatine once belonged to the Lady of the Lake.
However, its legends have been overshadowed by
its more famous counterpart, and therefore very
few people know of its true significance.

Another difference is the while Excalibur was said
to absorb the light radiated from the Earth,
Galantine reflected the warming rays of the Sun."

"A condition unique to Sir Gawain's existence.
During the hours between 9am and 12pm and those
between 3pm and sunset, all of his powers increase
by a factor of three. This was related to the
ancient belief that the numeral "3" was the
sacred number of the Celtic gods."

"One of the major knights mentioned in the
Arthurian legends and often thought to be King
Arthur's nephew.

A knight said to be the equal of Sir Lancelot,
Gawain was frequently at odds with Lancelot due to
his slaying of both of Gawain's brothers. Although
pure of heart and loyal beyond question, it was
Gawain's all-consuming hatred that not only led
to him being stripped of his knighthood, but also
led to the downfall of King Arthur himself.

Gawain was fatally wounded at the battle of
Camlann Hill after being struck in an old wound
caused by Lancelot. As he laid dying, he realized
that it was his own lack of virtue that lead to
Sir Lancelot's betrayal and the defeat of his King.

Up until his death, Sir Gawain was considered a
paragon of knighthood; chivalrous, loyal, and
gallant. Even as King Arthur became a legend,
Gawain was content to stay in the background,
doing his duty regardless of whether his efforts
were acknowledged or not. In reward for his
gallantry and loyalty to Arthur, as well as his
eventual forgiveness of Sir Lancelot, Gawain was
resurrected as a Heroic Spirit and, freed from
the sins of his past, has once again reclaimed
his role as the "Knight of the Sun.""

"The White Knight of the Round Table.

Widely considered to be the equal of King Arthur
by many and the wielder of the lesser-known holy
sword Galatine, Sir Gawain was fiercely loyal to
the King, or more accurately, the King's station.
Unlike Sir Bedivere, a trusted friend of Arthur's
who wished only that he would find peace and
contentment, Gawain's only concern was that
Arthur maintain the throne of Britain.

If King Arthur was seen as the personification of
the moon, then Sir Gawain was the harbinger of the
sun. He was frequently compared with Arthur,
although Gawain himself ignored these comparisons
and devoted himself to serving his king to the
best of his abilities. Though loyal to the end,
his irrational hatred of Sir Lancelot proved to
be his and Arthur's undoing.

Though Arthur eventually forgave his wayward
knight's transgressions, Sir Gawain could not find
it within himself to do the same until the very
last moments of his life and only after being
stripped of his knighthood, excommunicated from
the church, and causing the downfall of his
sovereign king.

With his dying breath, he swore that if he was
ever given a second chance at life, he'd support
his king, no matter what. Upon being reincarnated
as a Servant, Gawain devotes himself completely to
the goals of his Master and by doing so hopes to
gain absolution for the sins of his past."
