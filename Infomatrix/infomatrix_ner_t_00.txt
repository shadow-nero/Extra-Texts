"July 19, 64 AD.
A devastating fire erupted in one of the poorer
districts of Rome and quickly spread throughout
the city, reducing most of it to ashes. Contrary
to popular belief, Nero quickly responded to the
disaster and even contributed to relief efforts
out of her own personal funds. While she became
immensely popular with the common citizenry, her
populist policies combined with her sometimes
bizarre predilections earned her the ire of not
only the higher castes, but also of historians
who insist on painting her as a tyrant."

"A theater based on the palace Nero had built after
her original one burned to the ground. Called the
Domus Aurea, it was a grand villa built upon the
ruins of the homes of the aristocracy that once
covered the famed Esquiline Hill.

Historical accounts paint Nero as somewhat
delusional, and she herself has claimed that she
was an artist and performer of such incredible
gifts that only the god Apollo could match her
skills. She would often perform for the masses,
but those spectators would frequently leave
midway through her performances. She was so
enraged by this obvious act of disrespect that she
would order all entrances to the theater in which
she was performing to be sealed until the final
curtain fell.

This Noble Phantasm is based on the highest and
most difficult principles of thaumaturgy and
superficially resembles a Reality Marble, though
its effects are far more pronounced. It creates a
reality in which ones imperial aspirations can be
fully realized."

"Nullifies minor spells consisting of chants of two
verses or less. Ineffective against high-level
thaumaturgy and the greater rituals. As Saber
herself has a negligible resistance to magic, the
effectiveness of this skill is pathetically low,
even by the normal standard of the Saber class."

"In response to the demands of a Master, skills
that would otherwise be impossible to perform can
be used for a short period of time. Some of the
skills that can be acquired through this ability
include those related to riding, weapons mastery,
fine arts, military strategy, and diplomacy.
Should an A rank be achieved, more esoteric
skills become obtainable."

"A curse that was inherited from her place of birth
during her mortal life. As a result of the
crushing headaches inflicted by this condition,
the effectiveness of mental skills decreases
considerably. Another side effect that seems to
concern Saber most is the fact that it prevents her
from demonstrating what she considers her divine
talent for the performing arts."

"Nero reigned as emperor during the years 54 to
68 AD. Although most surviving contemporary
accounts paint her as a vicious tyrant who
disregarded the Senate and violently oppressed the
nascent Christian movement, many scholars believe
that these accounts were an attempt to discredit
her, as she was incredibly popular with
the citizenry.

Whatever the case, her infamy is such that some
theorize that the Book of Revelations found in the
Vulgate Bible was written as commentary on and
reaction to her supposed repression of the
Christian faith, and have gone so far as to make
the case that Hebrew pronunciation of her imperial
name (Caesar) +NRVN QSR+ is the same as the phrase
"Number of the Beast."

However, this has been proven to be patently
false, as that term commonly referred to Rome
itself, and not to any one individual, royal or
otherwise."

"Taking the name Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus
Germanicus upon her ascension to the imperial
throne, she was the fifth emperor of the Roman
Empire and the last of the Julio-Claudian dynasty,
who had ruled Rome since its inception.

The daughter of the cousin of the fourth emperor
Claudius, she was put upon the throne at the age
of seventeen as a result of the devious scheming
and possible mariticide by her mother, Julia
Augusta Agrippina. Once on the throne, she
immediately began to demonstrate her talents at
administration as well as her ability to navigate
the often murky political situation inherent in
Roman government.

In addition to the above, Nero was also generally
acknowledged to be a consummate diplomat who
preferred discussion and compromise to warfare and
conflict. She was held in especially high esteem
by both the peoples of Britannia and the leaders
of the nations of Persia, who continued to refer
to Rome as the "country of Nero" long after
her death.

While popular abroad and with the lower castes at
home, the Senate and the higher caste members of
the empire grew weary of her populist policies,
extravagant expenditures on public entertainments,
and occasionally irrational repression of
religious expression. In the year 68 AD, a series
of revolts drove Nero from the throne and
eventually to suicide. It was said that in her
final hours she continually expressed her anguish
that an artist such as herself had to die, but as
those who betrayed her closed in she quoted a line
from Homer's Iliad ("Hark, now strikes on my ear
the trampling of swift-footed coursers!") and then
drove a dagger into her throat."
