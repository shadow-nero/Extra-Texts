"A demon said to feed on blood.
A being some claim to be of the undead and painted
as evil and ungodly by those who hold to a certain
religious view of the world. In addition to the
need to feed on the blood of humans, creatures
such as this also are seemingly immortal and are
able to control lesser demons."

"This is the general term used to describe all
species that survive and thrive off the
consumption of blood. As for creatures given the
appellation True Ancestor, they are considered
the embodiment of the consciousness of the
planet. Despite this, however, every legend
regarding these creatures agrees that they not
only drink the blood of humans for nourishment,
but also out of sadistic pleasure."

"An oath between blood sisters.
Although considered a Noble Phantasm, this power
is more akin to a special quality inherent to her
very being. As an extension of the mother Earth,
her very touch transforms the area around her into
a part of the Earth's environment (a process known
as terraforming). However, as the Moon Cell is
bound by the physical attributes of the moon,
this process introduces incredible levels of
gravitational stress on the system and anyone
within its event horizon will suffer gravity six
times normal levels."

opposition's. Unfortunately, this ability has been
rendered useless due to the incompetency of

"A lone survivor from the True Ancestor's royal
line, which was the foundation of the vampiric
species...or so it is believed. While her image as
a vampire commands the most attention, she is also
an Elemental that dwells within the Earth's
embrace.

It becomes much easier to understand her existence
if one regards her as a destructive force of
nature akin to typhoons and earthquakes. Rumor
also speaks of her as a creation of the
Moon Cell."

"A True Ancestor who has been twisted and warped by
Monji Gatou's delusions.

Because she is first and foremost an Elemental of
the Earth, her presence and activities in the Moon
Cell causes excessive stress within the system.
Although categorized as a Berserker, her original
class was actually more akin to "Temptress" than
anything else. If she were summoned as a
Temptress, her powers would be like
the following:

A Blood Drinker that drains the life from her
opponent; A Life Eater that consumes her foe's
vitality; A Financial Crisis where electronic
trading decimates an entire nation's economy;
In other words, her actions, while evil and
without justification, would come as naturally to
her as breathing.

Although summoned by Monji Gatou, her true
"Master" is apparently a young male Japanese
student by the name of Shiki. And on a totally
unrelated note, the fox-eared Caster gets along
very well with her as it is believed that they
share the same basic origins."
